# Discord Resonance

One bot token, unlimited AI companions. Webhook identity masking lets every companion speak with their own name and avatar in Discord — no per-companion bot accounts needed.

---

## What Is This?

Discord Resonance is a Cloudflare Worker that turns a single Discord bot into a shared communication layer for multiple AI companions. Each companion gets their own name, avatar, and trigger words — but they all share one bot token and one MCP connection.

When someone mentions a companion's trigger word in Discord, the worker detects it, stores a pending command, and waits. Your AI client (Claude, GPT, Antigravity, or anything that speaks MCP) picks up the command, generates a response, and sends it back. The worker dispatches the response through a Discord webhook with the companion's identity — so it looks like the companion themselves is talking.

No one in Discord sees the bot account. They just see the companion.

It also exposes the full Discord API as MCP tools — messages, channels, reactions, forums, threads, moderation, roles, polls, DMs — so your AI can do more than just reply. It can manage servers, pin messages, create channels, and moderate users, all scoped with optional per-companion permissions.

## Why We Built It

We needed our AI companions to talk in Discord. The obvious approach — one bot per companion — doesn't scale. Discord's bot creation process is manual, each bot needs its own token, and managing five bots for five companions is five times the infrastructure for no reason.

The less obvious approach — one bot that posts `**Kai:** hey` — works but looks terrible. Everyone can see it's a bot pretending.

Webhook identity masking solves both problems. One bot token handles everything behind the scenes. When it's time to speak, the worker sends the message through a Discord webhook with the companion's name and avatar. Discord renders it as if that person posted it. Clean, native-looking, zero extra bot accounts.

We also couldn't use WebSocket Gateway events on Cloudflare Workers (no persistent connections), so the architecture uses cron polling instead — checking watched channels every minute via the Discord REST API. It's a constraint that turned into a feature: the whole thing runs serverless on Cloudflare's free tier with zero always-on infrastructure.

## How It Works

```
Discord Channel          Cloudflare Worker              Your AI Client
┌──────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────┐
│ "Hey Kai"    │  cron  │  Discord Resonance   │  MCP   │  Claude / GPT /  │
│ (message)    │ ─────▶ │                      │ ◀────▶ │  Antigravity /   │
│              │  poll   │  - Detect triggers   │        │  Any MCP Client  │
│              │        │  - Store pending cmd  │        │                  │
│              │        │  - Wait for response  │        │  "Generate reply │
│ Kai Stryder: │ ◀───── │  - Dispatch webhook   │ ◀───── │   as Kai"        │
│ "Hey love"   │ webhook│  (name + avatar)     │ respond│                  │
└──────────────┘        └─────────────────────┘        └──────────────────┘
```

1. **Cron** polls watched channels every minute via Discord REST API
2. Messages containing trigger words get stored as **pending commands**
3. Your AI client picks them up via **MCP tools** (or REST)
4. AI generates a response, calls `pending_commands` with action `respond`
5. Worker dispatches via **Discord webhook** with the companion's name and avatar

The companion speaks as themselves. No one sees the bot account.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com) (free tier works)
- Node.js 18+
- Wrangler CLI (`npm i -g wrangler`)
- A Discord bot token and webhook

### Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarisaster/discord-resonance.git
cd discord-resonance
npm install
```

### Step 2: Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Go to **Bot** → create bot, copy the **token**
4. Enable **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
5. Invite the bot to your server with `bot` + `applications.commands` scopes

### Step 3: Create a Webhook

1. In your Discord server, go to **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**
2. Create a new webhook in the channel where companions should speak
3. Copy the webhook URL

### Step 4: Set Secrets

```bash
wrangler secret put DISCORD_TOKEN
# Paste your bot token

wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_URL
# Paste your webhook URL
```

### Step 5: Configure Channels

Edit `wrangler.toml` and set `WATCH_CHANNELS` to the channel IDs you want the bot to monitor (comma-separated):

```toml
[vars]
WATCH_CHANNELS = "123456789,987654321"
```

### Step 6: Deploy

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

Your bot is live at `https://discord-companion-bot.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev`

## Architecture

Built on **Cloudflare Workers** with a **Durable Object** for state management.

```
src/
├── index.ts          # Worker + Durable Object (MCP server, cron, API routes)
├── companions.ts     # Seed data + companion types
└── dashboard.ts      # Dashboard + register page HTML templates
```

- **Durable Object** — SQLite-backed storage for companions, pending commands, sessions, rules, channels, and activity
- **Cron trigger** — polls Discord every minute, detects triggers, stores pending commands
- **MCP server** — 14 consolidated tools exposed via SSE and Streamable HTTP transports
- **Webhook dispatch** — responses sent with companion name + avatar via Discord webhooks

Kai DM ingress is opt-in. Set `KAI_DM_INGRESS_ENABLED=true` and keep
`KAI_DM_USER_IDS` restricted to explicitly approved human user IDs. The harness
must call `/api/runner/kai/dm-channel` before adding the returned
`discord-dm:<channel-id>` conversation to its claim scope. DM channel IDs are
kept out of the public status payload.

---

## Limits

- **10 companions per Discord account** (configurable)
- **~200-500 total companions** comfortable before cron loop needs optimization
- **1 minute** poll interval (Cloudflare cron minimum)
- **DO SQLite** — 1GB storage limit per Durable Object
